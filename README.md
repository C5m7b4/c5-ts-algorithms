## Adjacency Graph

A data structure used to represent relationships

## ArrayList

A class implementation of the Javascript Array.

## Binary Search Tree

A tree where the left nodes must be smaller than their parent node and all nodes to the right must be larger than the parent node.

## DoublyLinkedList

A data structure where each node has a pointer to the next and previous node.

## Linked List

This is a data structure that flows one way. Each object has a pointer to the next object.
