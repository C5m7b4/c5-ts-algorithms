## Adjacency Graph

A data structure used to represent relationships

## ArrayList

A class implementation of the Javascript Array.

## AVL Tree

This is basically a Binary Search Tree, but it can auto balance itself. It's pretty cool. We also have a visualizer to go with it in the example project.

## BinarySearch

A divide and conquer search method

## Binary Search Tree

A tree where the left nodes must be smaller than their parent node and all nodes to the right must be larger than the parent node.

## Bubble Sort

A very simple sorting algorithm

## CompareBinarySearchTrees

An algorithm that will compare two Binary Trees and tell you if they are a match or not

## DoublyLinkedList

A data structure where each node has a pointer to the next and previous node.

## Insertion Sort

Another sorting algorithm

### LinearSearch

A brute force search

## Linked List

This is a data structure that flows one way. Each object has a pointer to the next object.

## Merge Sort

A divide and conquer sorting method

## Quick Sort

A divide and conquer sorting algorithm
